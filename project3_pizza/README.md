# Project 3: Pizza

In this project I worked with Django and gained experience with relational database design.

You can see the result of this work on youtube by the link: https://youtu.be/hqUKOFKOL9Y

#### Overview

I built an web application for handling a pizza restaurant’s online orders. Users will be able to browse the restaurant’s menu, add items to their cart, and submit their orders. Meanwhile, the restaurant owners will be able to add and update menu items, and view orders that have been placed.

***My Personal Touch:*** 
allowing site administrators to mark orders as complete and allowing users to see the status of their pending or completed orders.

***Folders:***

- static - here are pictures for website; index.js with simle functions which helped me in this project; syles.css.

- templates - here are html files

- orders - here are python files, I wirked with admin.py, models.py, urls.py and views.py
