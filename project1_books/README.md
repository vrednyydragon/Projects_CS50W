#### Overview

In this project, I built a book review website. Users will be able to register for the website and then log in using their username and password. Once they log in, they will be able to search for books, leave reviews for individual books, and see the reviews made by other people. I also used a third-party API by Goodreads, another book review website, to pull in ratings from a broader audience. Finally, users will be able to query for book details and book reviews programmatically via the websiteâ€™s API.

For this project, I set up a PostgreSQL database to use with this application. I used a database hosted by Heroku, an online web hosting service.
