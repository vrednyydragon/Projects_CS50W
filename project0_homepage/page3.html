            <img src="snowboard.jpg" alt="snowboard" width=30% class="rightimg">
            <p> I love it so much. Three or four times during the winter I go to the mountains to snowboard.</p>
            <p>Snowboarding, winter sport with roots in skiing, surfing, and skateboarding where the primary activity is riding down any snow-covered surface while standing on a snowboard with feet positioned roughly perpendicular to the board and its direction, further differentiating it from skiing, in which riders face forward. Moreover, no poles are used as in skiing, and the majority of participants wear not hard but soft- to mid-flexing boots for support. The sport developed in the 1960s and ’70s, grew in popularity in the 1980s, and became an Olympic sport in 1998. To die-hard riders and enthusiasts worldwide, including this author, snowboarding is a special kind of “medicine for the soul,” combining the beauty of nature, the thrill of competition, and the opportunity for self-expression. There is no single way to snowboard.</p>

Two of the slope is very steep, but the north and south are relatively flat. Therefore, the rise of the hill will be interesting for both novice and professional climbers. Foot of the mountain is covered with pine forest. In summer it grows a lot of berries. But the fall season comes fragrant fungi. Great vacation on the background of beautiful nature and crystal air is provided to you. But the top of the mountain is a spacious poloninu. The aroma of mountain herbs brings a special romantic mood. What is interesting on the mountain Gore is a part of Carpathian Reserve. Among other things, on the mountain grows a lot of rare plants, some of which are listed as endangered. It is also interesting to watch the wild animals that live on the slopes of the mountain. Lovers of ski kinds of entertainment on the northeast slope of waiting for the ski resort "Dragobrat". Slopes suitable for all.

            <h2 id ="section2">Kayaking</h2>

            <p>Kayaking is a portion of adrenaline during the fight against water element and descent on fast mountain rivers, communication with nature, physical activity and the ability to test you for endurance.</p>
            <p>Interesting facts about this sport:
                <ol>
                    <li>The name “Kayak” means “hunter’s boat” as kayaks were originally invented by the Inuit, Yup’Ik, and the Aleut for hunting. They were made of seal or other animal skin stretched over wood or whale bone. Kayaks are very quiet which made them ideal for sneaking up on prey. </li>
                    <li> Kayaking received the honor of Olympic status when it became an official Olympic sport, along with canoeing, at the summer Olympics in Berlin, Germany.</li>
                    <li>“Kleppers” (two man kayaks) have been used in special missions of insertion or extraction by the US Marines, British Commandos and The Canadian Special Operations Forces Command during war. </li>
                    <li>The Country with the most Olympic medals in kayaking is Hungary. </li>
                    <li>The world record for the most kayaks to ever “raft up” together is 1902 kayaks! It happened in Inlet, New York in 2011. </li>
                    <li>As kayaking has evolved, there have become different types of kayaks, depending on their intended use. Some different types of kayaks include: “Sit on tops,” are as the name suggests, a type of kayak where the paddler sits on top of the kayak in an open area. “Cockpit style” is the more conventional style kayak where the paddler sits inside the kayak with his/her hips and legs inside the hull. A spray skirt may also be used to create a barrier against splashing water. “Inflatables” are a type of kayak that are a mixture of a “sit on top” and a “cockpit style” kayak. They have an open deck but the paddler sits below the deck. “Tandems” are made for more than one paddler. Some tandems can have up to 3 or 4 paddlers per kayak. </li>
                    <li> The world record for the highest waterfall drop in kayak (189 feet) is held by American extreme kayaker, Tyler Bradt. Tyler kayaked over Palouse Falls in 2009, earning him the record title.</li>
                    <li> The first person to cross the Atlantic ocean in a kayak was 29-year-old WW1 veteran, Franz Romer. In 1928, the German-born kayaker left Lisbon, Portugal and traveled 4,000 miles to arrive in Puerto Rico.</li>

He crashed within seconds, bruising his ego and starting the roller-skating craze. </li>
                    <li>It’s Good for You.
