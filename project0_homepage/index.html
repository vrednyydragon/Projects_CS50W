It was one of the first stations, which were built in 1960 next to the parlament building.

On the second place is the station ‘Park Pobedy’; it’s depth lasts 84 meters (now it’s depth is biggest in Russia).</li>
                <li>Scientists have found the most ancient map and settlement of the Homo Sapiens at the territory of modern Kiev. Wonderful finds were made in Mezhyrechje, Rivnenska oblast.
