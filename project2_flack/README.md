This project is an online messaging service using Flask, similar in spirit to Slack. Users will be able to sign into your site with a display name, create channels (i.e. chatrooms) to communicate in, as well as see and join existing channels. Once a channel is selected, users will be able to send and receive messages with one another in real time. 

***Personal Touch:*** 
- blincking non-active channels, if there messages come;
- sending files;
- sending images.

***Folders and files:***

- static  - folder that contains styles.css, index.js, download_pic.png, send_file.png.
- templates - folder that contains index.html.
- application.py, 
- .gitignore, 
- requirements.txt, 
- README.md
